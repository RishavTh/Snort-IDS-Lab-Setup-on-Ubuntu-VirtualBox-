# 🛡️ Snort IDS Lab Setup on Ubuntu (VirtualBox)

This project demonstrates the installation and configuration of **Snort**, an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS), on **Ubuntu Server** using **VirtualBox**. The goal was to simulate and detect network-based attacks (using Nmap scans) in a blue team lab environment.

## 📌 Objectives
- Deploy Snort on a virtual Ubuntu server
- Simulate real attacks using Nmap from Kali Linux
- Detect and analyze alerts generated by Snort
- Build a reusable virtual IDS lab for further experimentation

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 (VirtualBox)
- Snort 2.9.15.1
- Kali Linux with Nmap
- nano (for config edits)

## 🧪 Lab Deployment Overview
1. Installed Snort via `apt`
2. Configured `HOME_NET` and other essential settings
3. Ran simulated Nmap scans from Kali
4. Observed Snort detecting "BAD-TRAFFIC", SNMP scans, and UDP broadcasts
5. Alerts logged in real time to `snort.alert.fast`

## 📊 Results
- Snort successfully detected malicious and suspicious traffic
- Real-time alert logging confirmed proper IDS operation

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Faced
- Interface mismatch issues
- Improper `HOME_NET` settings
- Required VirtualBox NIC adjustments

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Create custom Snort rules
- Integrate with ELK Stack or Wazuh for visualization
- Enable alert forwarding via syslog or email
